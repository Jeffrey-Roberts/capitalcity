				<h2>History of Capital City</h2>
				<p>The great capital city was founded in 1863 by <em>Curt W William</em>. Mr. Williams set out to create a haven of peace and equal opportunity in a country tearing itself apart through the Civil War. He began his community in 1862 on the coast of South Carolina. People began to flock to this new rumored haven.</p>

				<p>People began to pour into Mr. William's newly established haven, and it soon became a flourishing agricultural and fishing settlement. By 1863 the settlement had grown into a small city of 5,000 people. It was also during this time that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves of America. Almost every member of the community became involved in the Under Ground Railroad. This put the newly founded Capital City on the map.</p> 

				<p>Since that historical moment, Capital City has become known as one of the friendliest cities in America. People from all over flock to the still flourishing Capital City to find a safe and tolerant place to live their lives.</p>
